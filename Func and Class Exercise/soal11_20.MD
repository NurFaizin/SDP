# Question 11
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001

Then the output should be:
1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints:
- Use raw_input()
- Use list
- Use append method 
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 12
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
- Use list
- Use append method 
- Use join method to concatenate the string output
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 13
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123

Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3

Hints:
- Use raw_input()
- Use dictionary
- Use isdigit and isalpha method to get boolean value
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 14
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!

Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9

Hints:
- Use raw_input()
- Use dictionary
- Use isupper method to get boolean value
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 15
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
D 100
W 200
D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100

Then, the output should be:
500

Hints:
- Use While-loop statement
- Use raw_input()
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 16
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345

Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

Hints:
- Use raw_input()
- Use re.search (regex) to match the pattern, remember to "import re"
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 17
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.

If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85

Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

Hints:
- Use itemgetter to enable multiple sort keys 
- from operator import itemgetter, attrgetter
- Use raw_input()
- Use tuple()
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 18
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

Hints:
- Consider use yield
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 19
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.

Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Hints
- use raw_input()
#----------------------------------------#

# Question 20
Define a class named Indonesia and its subclass Betawi.
